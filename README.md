# OpenAi-API
"Consuming the OpenAI API. Utilizing the available resources of gpt-3.5-turbo."
It's important to emphasize that one should read the API documentation before attempting to use it. There, you will find precise and relevant information to start studying/testing. Remember that API keys have expiration dates and credits are consumed with API usage, so it's good to stay attentive.
